## Help with the project
This is the third project of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp">freeCodeCamp.org</a> tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ 
with more comments.

This is a project made in Remix so you can just add the contract <a href="https://github.com/K-Konstantinidis/Fund-Me-Remix/blob/master/contracts/FundMe.sol">FundMe</a> 
in your workspace and deploy them!
